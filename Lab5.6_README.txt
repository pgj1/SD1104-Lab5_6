LAB 5.6: If Statement
Lesson Time: 60 Minutes

In this lesson, we are going to put everything we learned today together while practicing IF statements.

Scenario:
You work for the company World Of Beer, which makes and sells high-quality craft beer. World of Beer lets 
customers shop online, and will ship orders directly to their customers. World of Beer won’t allow a customer 
under 21, so they need you to implement logic that stops the customer from ordering if their profile shows they 
are under 21.

Additionally, World of Beer offers customers a premium membership for a price. If the customer has a premium membership, 
they get special offers and discounts on orders.

Your job in this lab is to use a struct to create a Customer, and then implement IF statements to check if 
they of legal age to order and belong to membership programs.

Each customer should have a first name and last name, age, and membership status.
Create 3 customers and test all of them with IF Then Statements.
1. Customer 1 is underage
2. Customer 2 is legal age but not a premium member
3. Customer 3 is legal age and a premium member

Good luck!
